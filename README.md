# Breast Cancer Prediction
This is an implementation of several classifier models for breast cancer prediction data. The data can be seen in `data.csv` and the description is given in `data_description.txt`.
Looking forward to commits for different classifiers! Do send PR for new classifiers. It would be great is noise can be added to the existing dataset.

## Setup
You can run the models individually using `python <model>.py`

Add all visualizations to `visualizer.ipynb`
